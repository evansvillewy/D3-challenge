          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Based on the data set analyzed, as the percentage of poverty increases, the lack of healthcare 
            increases as well. This coincides with the increase in household income and decrease in the 
            lack of healthcare. We can see Mississippi has the highest percentage of poverty and lack of healthcare.
          </p>
          <p>Interestingly, as the percentage of poverty increases so does the percentage of smokers. Which is consistent 
            with the reduction in smokers as the household income increases.
          </p>
          <p>The percentage of obesity decreases as the household income increases. This correlates with the increase 
            in obesity as the percentage of poverty increases.
          </p>
          <p>The percentage of obesity and smokers increases as age increases.
